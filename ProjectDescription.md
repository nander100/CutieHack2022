WorldBuild Project

The project's purpose is to allows users to create text stories in the form of choose-your-adventures. Our project designs an engine which allows users to dialogue and determine user options which lead to different pathways of stories. 

Secondly, we hope to add a GUI which allows the program to be user-friendly and accessible. Through this GUI, we will have options and stories displayed -- which allows users to open files and play through the stories.
